So, you ever get that feeling that no matter how hard you try it's always 1 step forward, 2 steps back!!!! Well let me tell you, I thought I had a WHOLE lot figured out LOL HA HA HA ----NOT! So coding is Awsome, but not when you have a newborn in the house(kinda makes it really hard to concentrate), but hey, I regress. I think that long hours in front of a computer screen in a dimly lit room is EVERY Grandpa's dream, just think of the tranquility, and alone time.......In this time I have had quite some time to myself for self reflection, and I have come to the realization that I am somewhat of a intravert(which is really funny, because my High School Counselor said just the opposite!!Boy was she wrong) Back to the whole "coding" thing, I do really enjoy making something work just to break it. It's kind of like when I was a young lad and would play light bulb baseball with my brother and cousins at my Granpa's farm.(Well not really, but you get the point?) My wife said the other day that I sounded like a real honest to goodness programmer, because the ones she works with are saying that all the time about how they are only there to fix the things everyone else breaks.
So back to this whole project thing, I think it would be more beneficial for someone of my "lesser" calliber to have more one on one time with either an instructor, or maybe a tutor, that way I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed by the whole deadline aspect of the project....just sayin. Even when it's all said and done, I still feel some accomplishment, because a few months ago i had no "real" working knowledge of coding, HTML's CSS Ruby(I always thought was the gemstone for July) Github, or the many other vast plethera of information overload that I have been getting. So, thank you all very much, and I do mean that with sincererity and heartfelt warmness.
Anyway just my 2 cents for what its worth.
