So, CoVid Quarantine.....I guess I feel quite lucky that I have had the opportunity to be involved in such an historic event. When my grandchildren are older I will be able to teel them about the "horrible pandemic" that I had to live through. I now work from home (as most people do), as part of the "new norm." I am especially thrilled and thankful for the opportunity to be part of such a wonderful schooling expierence. 
Since joining Flatiron I have had the honor of meeting such warm and wonderful people from all over the place. I had some "coding" and "speadsheet" expierence before coming to Flatiron, but now my eyes have been opened to things like HTML and CSS and especially RUBY!!!!
To learn about Variables and Methods has been quite an AWESOME expierence. Ruby has four types of variable scope, local, global, instance and class. Also, uniquely one constant type. Each variable type is is declared by using a special character at the start of the varible name. For example:

Name Begins with--Variable Scope
 	               $            =          A global variable
                @	          =          An Instance variable
         [a-z] or _	    =          A local variable
             @@	        =           A class variable
						 
						[A-Z] 	      =           A constant variable
						
Without going into the "bubble" inside the "bubble" and so on.......so far the journey has been quite exciting, and at times frustrating.  By looking at Methods A LOT of things became more clear. Quite often there will be a piece of code that needs to be executed many times in a program. Instead of writing that piece of code over and over, there's a feature in most programming languages called a procedure, which allows you to extract the common code to one place. In Ruby, it is called a "Method."
I could keep going (literally for days), but maybe on my next topic??
Thanks for reading!!
