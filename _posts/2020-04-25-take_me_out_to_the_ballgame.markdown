"To Code or Not to Code That is the Question?"

I have always had a great facination for computers, logic, and math ("I know, NERD!!") For the last 8 plus years, I have worked as a Pharmacy Technician for various pharmacies. With this I have had to learn A LOT!!!!! of new systems, and processes. I even got to learn SQL and Excel programming recently at one of my previous jobs. I thought to myself "Wouldn't it be AWESOME if I could fix some of the *Obvious* programming errors and bugs in the healthcare systems that I use?" Then I heard about Flatiron School and Voila!!! The lightbulb appeared over my head! I know that some simple tweaks and adjustments to the programming of these sytems would definetly enhance productivity.

I know that I have the drive, devotion, and determination to complete the tasks set in front of me. The reason I am so sure of this is because my wife said so! The future is ultimately changing, and if you don't want to be left behind, you better keep up!
